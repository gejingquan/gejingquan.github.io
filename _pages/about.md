I am now a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University. I am interested in all aspects of system security, including cache attacks and defenses, control flow integrity, fuzzing, AI security, hot patching, etc. My current research fields include root cause analysis of software bugs, vehicle system security, cache side channel defense, etc. The techniques I utilize include, but are not limited to, Linux and kernel programming, software-hardware co-design. I am good at ARMv8-A Linux and kernel technology and FPGA hardware programming.
